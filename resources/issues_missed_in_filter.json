In this migration, we will include comprehensive tests for the Service Mesh Performance Management component. This will ensure that functionalities such as running performance tests, viewing and editing performance profiles, deleting profiles, viewing and comparing test results, and scheduling tests are thoroughly tested and tracked in  [ Meshery Test Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13Ir4gfaKoAX9r8qYjAFFl_U9ntke4X5ndREY1T7bnVs/edit?pli=1&gid=0#gid=0).\r\n\r\n### Desired Behavior\r\nMigrate the existing tests to Playwright to achieve a more robust and efficient testing framework. The new Playwright tests should cover the following scenarios:\r\n\r\n- [x] `Run a performance test`\r\n\r\n- [x]  `Run a performance test with a performance profile`\r\n\r\n- [x]  `View/Edit the configuration of a performance profile`\r\n\r\n- [ ]  `Delete a performance profile`\r\n\r\n- [x]  `View results from a performance profile`\r\n\r\n- [x] ` View detailed result of a performance profile (Graph Visualiser)`\r\n\r\n- [ ] `Download, compare and schedule a performance test`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Contributor [Guides](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing) and [Handbook](https://layer5.io/community/handbook)\r\n\r\n- 🎨 Wireframes and [designs for Meshery UI](https://www.figma.com/file/SMP3zxOjZztdOLtgN4dS2W/Meshery-UI) in Figma [(open invite)](https://www.figma.com/team_invite/redeem/qJy1c95qirjgWQODApilR9)\r\n- 🖥 [Contributing to Meshery UI](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-ui)\r\n- 🙋🏾🙋🏼 Questions: [Discussion Forum](http://discuss.meshery.io) and [Community Slack](https://slack.meshery.io)\r\n",
